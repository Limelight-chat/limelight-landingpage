Good design is invisible. It's the tool that feels like an extension of your hand, the interface that anticipates your needs before you even articulate them. At Limelight, we believe that the best AI tools are the ones you don't notice.

## Minimalism as a Feature

We stripped away the clutter. No complex dashboards, no overwhelming settings menus. Just a clean, command-line interface and a subtle IDE integration.

## The "Flow" State

Every decision we made was guided by one principle: **preserve the flow**. Context switching is the enemy of productivity. By bringing AI capabilities directly into your workflow, we ensure that you stay in the zone.

### Color Theory

We chose our color palette—deep blacks, vibrant oranges—not just for aesthetics, but to reduce eye strain during long coding sessions and to highlight critical information without being distracting.

We hope you enjoy using Limelight as much as we enjoyed designing it.
