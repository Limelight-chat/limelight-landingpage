We are thrilled to unveil **Limelight**, a project we've been pouring our hearts into for the past year. Limelight isn't just another tool; it's a reimagining of how developers interact with artificial intelligence.

## Why Limelight?

In a world saturated with AI assistants, we felt something was missing. Tools were either too generic, lacking context about your specific codebase, or too intrusive, breaking your flow. Limelight strikes the perfect balance.

### Key Features

- **Context-Aware**: Limelight understands your project structure, dependencies, and coding style.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works right where you do, in your terminal and IDE.
- **Privacy First**: Your code never leaves your machine for training without your explicit permission.

## The Journey Ahead

This is just the beginning. We have a roadmap packed with exciting features, including collaborative coding sessions, advanced debugging capabilities, and more.

Join us on this journey. Download the beta today and let us know what you think.
