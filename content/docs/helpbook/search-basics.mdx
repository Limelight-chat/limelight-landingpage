# Search Basics

Limelight's search is designed to be intuitive and powerful. Here's how to make the most of it.

## Using the Search Bar

Simply type your query into the search bar. You can ask natural language questions like:

*   "What was the revenue for Q3?"
*   "Show me emails from John about the project."
*   "Find the latest design specs."

## Filtering Results

You can filter results by:

*   **Source:** Google Drive, Slack, Notion, etc.
*   **Date:** Last week, last month, custom range.
*   **Type:** Document, Email, Image.

## Understanding Relevance

Limelight uses semantic search to understand the meaning behind your query, not just keyword matching. This ensures you get the most relevant results, even if the exact words don't match.
